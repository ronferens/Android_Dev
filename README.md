## Call Back Later
Latest version - V7.0.0 @22.6.2015

**_Call Back Later_** is an Android application designed to help you manage the important calls you would like to get back to whenever you wish, including missed and rejected ones.

Once a call is added to your list, you don't need to go over your entire calls backlog again to make sure you get back to it. You simply use the integrated action buttons (_Call_, _SMS_) and off you go.

The application can be found at [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jellyfish.illbeback&hl=en)



## Smart Notes
Latest Version - _Work-In-Progress_

**_Smart Notes_** allows you to create customized contexts that will help you manage your day-to-day life.
Once a context have been created you can use it to assign new notes. The application monitors the list of the user's contexts and displays only the relevant ones.

A context conssist of location and/or time. For example, **@Work** can refer to Mon-Fri from 8:00-17:00. Once defined, a user can create a new note with a @Work context. This will ensure that this note will be shown only it is relevant.

Other useful contexts can be: @Home, @Mall, @WhileDriving ect.
