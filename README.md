## Call Back Later
Latest version - V7.0.0 @22.6.2015

**_Call Back Later_** is an Android application designed to help you manage the important calls you would like to get back to whenever you wish, including missed and rejected ones.

Once a call is added to your list, you don't need to go over your entire calls backlog again to make sure you get back to it. You simply use the integrated action buttons (_Call_, _SMS_) and off you go.

The application can be found at [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.jellyfish.illbeback&hl=en)
